Hello! Welcome to G.A.M.E (Graphical Adventure maze Experience)! A fun and interesting adventure from a jungle you find yourself stranded in, to back home!


Hope you'll enjoy this experience! However, before we get started, here are some rules:
1.You will have to pass through 3 stages and make smart choices to survive. 
2.Each stage will end with a small puzzle that you have to figure out to move on to the next stage. 
3.You have 3 lives at the start of the game, however, whenever you make a wrong choice, your lives will decrease. 
4.Crossing each puzzle will get you a new life. 
5.Categories will be given to you at the beginning of each puzzle. Choose wisely a topic which you're well versed in, as all questions will pertain to it. 
6.Each stage will have a few difficult choices to be made, but look at the clues hidden within the question to be able to make it through.
